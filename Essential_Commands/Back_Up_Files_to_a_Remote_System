🛡️ Basic File & Disk Backup in Linux (Using rsync and dd)
🧠 Goal:
Back up files from one system to another, or make a disk image of a full partition/disk — using simple native tools.

🔄 Part 1: File & Folder Backup with rsync
📌 What is rsync?
Stands for: Remote Synchronization

Used to sync directories locally or remotely over SSH

Smart: Only copies changed files after the first sync

🛠️ Basic Syntax
bash

rsync -a SOURCE/ USER@IP:/DESTINATION/
-a = Archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, subdirectories)

Trailing / on the source and destination is important

📦 Example: Backup local folder to remote server
bash
Copy
Edit
rsync -a /home/aaron/pictures/ aaron@9.9.9.9:/home/aaron/pictures/
📥 Pull from remote to local
bash
Copy
Edit
rsync -a aaron@9.9.9.9:/home/aaron/pictures/ /home/aaron/pictures/
📁 Local-to-local sync (same machine)
bash
Copy
Edit
rsync -a /home/aaron/pictures/ /backup/pictures/
✅ Benefits of rsync
Feature	Description
Smart sync	Only updates changed files
Secure	Works over SSH
Fast	Skips identical files
Flexible	Local or remote sync

💿 Part 2: Disk or Partition Backup with dd
📌 What is dd?
Used to make exact disk or partition images

Copies bit-by-bit (useful for full backups or cloning)

⚠️ Important Before Using dd:
Unmount the disk or partition you're backing up:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo umount /dev/sdX1
Use sudo because raw disk access requires root

🛠️ Backup Disk to File
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=~/disk-backup.img bs=1M status=progress
Flag	Meaning
if=	Input file (disk or partition)
of=	Output file (where to store the image)
bs=1M	Block size = 1 MB (for speed)
status=progress	Show progress while copying

💡 Replace /dev/sdX with your actual device (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/sdb1, etc.)

🔁 Restore Disk Image
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo dd if=~/disk-backup.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
⚠️ This will overwrite the disk → Be careful, especially in virtual machines!

✅ Summary: rsync vs dd
Feature	rsync	dd
Use Case	Files/Folders	Entire Disks/Partitions
Smart Sync	Yes	No (bit-by-bit)
Remote Backup	Yes	No (needs SSH + file copy)
Incremental	Yes	No
Safer	✅ Yes	⚠️ Risky (overwrites whole disks)

🧪 Practice Exercise (Safe & Simple)
🔁 Practice rsync
Make two test folders:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir source_folder backup_folder
echo "hello" > source_folder/test1.txt
Sync them:

bash
Copy
Edit
rsync -a source_folder/ backup_folder/
Modify the file and sync again:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "new content" >> source_folder/test1.txt
rsync -a source_folder/ backup_folder/
Observe how only the changed file gets updated.

🚫 Don't try dd on your main disk unless you're 100% sure.
Use it only if you're cloning:

A spare disk
