🔍 Searching for Files in Linux with find
1. 📂 Basic find Syntax
bash
Copy
Edit
find <path> <search-criteria>
✅ Always specify the path first, then search criteria.

2. 📄 Search by File Name
Exact match (case-sensitive):
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -name "file.txt"
Case-insensitive:
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -iname "file.txt"
Wildcard pattern (e.g. all .jpg files):
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -name "*.jpg"
find . -name "f*"
3. 🕒 Search by Modification Time
Recent changes (in minutes):
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -mmin -5      # modified in the last 5 minutes
find /path -mmin +5      # modified more than 5 minutes ago
find /path -mmin 5       # modified exactly 5 minutes ago
Recent changes (in days):
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -mtime 0      # modified in last 24 hours
find /path -mtime 1      # modified 24–48 hours ago
Metadata changes:
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -cmin -5      # metadata changed in last 5 mins
4. 💾 Search by File Size
Suffix	Unit
c	Bytes
k	Kilobytes
M	Megabytes
G	Gigabytes

bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -size 512k     # exactly 512 KB
find /path -size +20G     # greater than 20 GB
find /path -size -10M     # less than 10 MB
5. 🔐 Search by File Permissions
Match exact permissions:
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -perm 664
Match at least these permissions:
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -perm -664     # must include 664 or more
Match any of these permissions:
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -perm /664     # at least 1 matching bit
Symbolic format example:
bash
Copy
Edit
find /path -perm -u=r     # user has read permission
find /path -perm -u=rw,g=r
6. ❗ Logical Operators in find
AND (default):
bash
Copy
Edit
find . -name "f*" -size 512k
OR:
bash
Copy
Edit
find . -name "f*" -o -size 512k
NOT:
bash
Copy
Edit
find . ! -name "f*"
# or
find . -not -name "f*"
Use \! if Bash misinterprets !.

7. 🔒 Search by Access Rights
Goal	Command
Files only readable/writable by owner	find . -perm 600
Files executable by owner	find . -perm -100
Files where others cannot read	find . ! -perm /004
Files readable by anyone (user/group/others)	find . -perm /004

8. 🧠 Remember This Logic
-perm 644: exact match

-perm -644: minimum required permissions

-perm /644: any matching permission

-mmin/-mtime: time since modification

-size +10M: greater than 10 MB

Use quotes around patterns with * or special characters
