Rebooting and Shutting Down Linux Systems
1. Reboot and Shutdown (Basic Commands)
systemctl reboot
Reboots the system (requires root privileges).

systemctl poweroff
Powers off the system (also needs root privileges).

If you're not logged in as root, use sudo:

sudo systemctl reboot

sudo systemctl poweroff

2. Force Reboot or Shutdown (Only When Necessary)
sudo systemctl reboot --force

sudo systemctl poweroff --force

Double force (dangerous, last resort):

sudo systemctl reboot --force --force

sudo systemctl poweroff --force --force

This is equivalent to hitting the physical reset/power button â€” no cleanup, unsafe shutdown.

3. Scheduled Reboot or Shutdown
sudo shutdown 02:00
Schedule shutdown at 2:00 AM.

sudo shutdown +15
Shutdown after 15 minutes.

sudo shutdown -r 02:00
Reboot at 2:00 AM.

sudo shutdown -r +10 'Scheduled restart for kernel upgrade'
Reboot after 10 minutes with a wall message shown to all logged-in users.

4. Wall Message
Add a message in single quotes at the end of the command to notify logged-in users:

'Scheduled restart to upgrade Linux kernel'
