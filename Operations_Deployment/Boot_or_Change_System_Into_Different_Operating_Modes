📘 Linux System Boot Process with systemd Targets
🖥️ What Happens During Boot?
When Linux boots, it loads many programs.

These programs are managed and ordered using systemd targets.

A target is a collection of system services grouped for a specific purpose (e.g., graphical login, text mode, rescue, etc.).

🔍 How to Check the Default Target
Command:

arduino
Copy
Edit
systemctl get-default
Example Output:

Copy
Edit
graphical.target
This means the system boots into a graphical environment by default.

🧠 What is a Target?
Each target file (like graphical.target) contains:

A list of required services.

The order in which they should run.

This tells the system what to load and when to reach the desired environment.

⚙️ Changing the Default Boot Target
To boot into text mode (no GUI), use:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
The multi-user target:

Loads system services and daemons.

Supports multiple users.

Enables networking.

Skips the graphical interface (text-based only).

Reboot the system to apply:

nginx
Copy
Edit
sudo reboot
👨‍💻 After Reboot: Text-Based Login
The login screen will now be a text console.

You can still log in and use the system via terminal.

🔄 Temporarily Switch to GUI Without Reboot
To temporarily start the graphical interface:

nginx
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
This launches the graphical UI.

Does not change the default target.

On next reboot, you'll go back to multi-user (text) mode.

🧯 Special Recovery Targets
1. emergency.target
Loads minimal services.

Mounts root file system as read-only.

Useful for debugging system problems.

Only the most essential system components are loaded.

2. rescue.target
Loads a few more services than emergency.

Provides a root shell.

Lets you:

Fix system issues.

Restore config files.

Backup data without starting the full system.

Requires root password to access.

🔑 Note About Root Access
To access rescue or emergency targets:

A root password must be set.

These targets drop you into a root shell.

✅ Summary of Common systemd Targets
Target	Description

multi-user.target	Text-based, networked, multi-user mode
rescue.target	Minimal mode with root shell
emergency.target	Bare minimum, read-only system
